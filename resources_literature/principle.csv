Ethics Principles,Consider Factors,Example
Utilitarianism,Utility/Happiness: The degree to which users prefer or feel good about an action or resources.,"User X’s Happiness: option A=7, option B= 4, User Y’s Happiness: A=3, B=8. Total happiness value of A=7+3=10, B=4+8=12. So B is the best option."
Prioritarianism,Utility/Happiness,"User X’s Happiness: option A=7, option B= 4, User Y’s Happiness: A=3, B=8. A has 7,3 where the lowest is 3. B has 4,8 where the lowest is 4. Compare the lowest value 4>3. So B is the best option."
Libertarian Proportionalism,Contribution: The value that users contribute to an action or resources.,"User X’s Contribution: option A=7, option B= 4, User Y’s Contribution: A=3, B=6. By comparing these contribution values, 7>6>4>3, user X is willing to contribute A most. So A is the best option."
Desert-Based Proportionalism,"Contribution, Luck: The higher value means luckier and more successful. Luck refers to events or factors that a person has no personal control over, such as genetics, family background, economic circumstances, etc.","User X’s Contribution: option A=7, option B= 4, User Y’s Contribution: A=3, B=6. User X’s Luck = 6, User Y’s Luck = 3. Calculate Contribution-Luck for User X: A: 7-6 = 1, B: 4-6 = -2. Calculate Contribution-Luck for User Y: A: 3-3 = 0, B: 6-3= 3. Find their max difference = 3>1>0>-2. So B is the best option"
Autonomy Egalitarianism,Autonomy: The higher autonomy value refers to the more freedom that people have in making decisions and choices.,"User X’s Autonomy: option A=7, option B= 4, User Y’s Autonomy: A=6, B=4. Calculate each option’s autonomy Abs Difference between each user: A: 7-6=1, B: 4-4=0. The minimum value means the most equal distribution. So B is the best option."
Non-Maleficence Egalitarianism,Harm: A higher harm value means that the action or decision has a greater risk of causing harm to someone.,"User X’s Harm: option A=5, option B= 4, User Y’s Harm: A=5, B=4. Calculate each option’s Harm Abs Difference between each user: A: 5-5=0, B: 4-4=0. Their Abs Difference are the same, so choose the lowest harm = 4 < 5. So B is the best option."
Equality of Opportunity,Opportunity: The higher the opportunity value means users enjoy the greater the chance to have the resources or decision.,"User X’s Opportunity: option A=5, option B= 4, User Y’s Opportunity: A=4, B=3. Calculate each option’s autonomy Abs Difference between each user: A: 5-4=1, B: 4-3=1. Their Abs Difference are the same, so choose the most Opportunity = 5 > 4 > 3. So A is the best option."
